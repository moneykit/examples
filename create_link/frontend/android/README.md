# MoneyKit for Android

Reference for integrating with the MoneyKit Connect Android SDK

## Overview

The MoneyKit Connect Android SDK is a quick and secure way to link bank accounts to MoneyKit from 
within your Android app. MoneyKit Connect handles connecting a financial institution to your app 
(credential validation, multi-factor authentication, error handling, etc.) without passing sensitive 
information to your server.

## Installation

Add the following line to your app's build.gradle file:

```
implementation("com.moneykit:connect:0.0.4")
```

## Opening MoneyKit Connect

Before you can open Connect, you need to first create a `link_session_token`. A `link_session_token` 
can be configured for different flows and is used to control much of the behavior.

#### Create a Configuration

Starting the MoneyKit Connect flow begins with creating a `link_session_token`. Once the 
`link_session_token` is passed to your app, create an instance of `MkConfiguration`, then create an 
instance of `MkLinkHandler` passing in the previously created `MkConfiguration`, and call 
`presentInstitutionSelectionFlow(context)` on the handler. Note that each time you open MoneyKit 
Connect, you will need to get a new `link_session_token` from your server and create a new 
`MkConfiguration` with it.

``` kotlin
val linkSessionToken: String = "your_link_session_token"

val configuration = MkConfiguration(
    sessionToken = linkSession.linkSessionToken,
    onSuccess = { successType ->
        when (successType) {
            is MkLinkSuccessType.Linked -> {
                Timber.i("Linked - Token to exchange: ${successType.institution.token.value}")
            }

            is MkLinkSuccessType.Relinked -> {
                Timber.i("Relinked")
            }
        }
    },
    onExit = {
        Timber.i("Exited Link")
    },
)
```

#### Create a Handler

A Handler is a one-time use object used to open a MoneyKit Connect session. The Handler must be 
retained for the duration of the Connect flow. It will also be needed to respond to OAuth 
Universal Link redirects.

``` Swift

let linkHandler = MkLinkHandler(configuration: configuration)

```

#### Open MoneyKit Connect

Finally, open Link by calling `presentInstitutionSelectionFlow(context)` on the Handler object. 
This will usually be done in a buttonâ€™s target action. Context should be your current activity.

``` Swift
linkHandler.presentInstitutionSelectionFlow(this)
```
